              <h1 style="font-size: 4em;">Welcome To Leaks.ng</h1>
              <p>Leaks.ng allows you to leak confidential documents of public interest. We've designed the system to help you share these materials while protecting your own identity, making it very hard to identify you as the source of the leak.</p>

              <p>Leaks.ng is run by a coalition of Nigerian news organisations and civil society organisations that are committed to speaking truth to power. You can send us documents and select which of our member organisations should perform an investigation. This site also helps you to stay in touch and answer further questions without revealing your name or contact information.</p>

              <h1>How to leak confidential documents</h1>
              <p>If you have information about issues which should be investigated, share them with one of Leaks.ng's news partners using this site. Consider that concrete information and evidence, such as source documents, gives a journalist more to work with and increases the likelihood that your issue gets taken up.</p>
              <h2>Protect your identity</h2>
              <p>Leaking sensitive information involves risks. There are both social and technical risks that threaten your anonymity. At the same time, there are measures you can take to protect yourself. See 'Your Security' for more details.</p>
              <h2>Who should receive your information?</h2>
              <p>The press checks those in power and exposes misconduct or abuse of power. The media has the resources to bring issues into the public light. Journalists are professionals who investigate, ask critical questions, and ensure all parties involved are asked about their side of the story. Furthermore, they work for mass media (newspapers, magazines, websites, radio, or television programs) through which they can make their research public.</p>
